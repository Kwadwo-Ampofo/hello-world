# hello-world
Just creating my first repository 

My name is Benedict and i am a doctor , a farmer and i am trying to teach myself some bit of data science.
I have recently discovered my love for data and its potential to affect human life and thus i want to learn more of how i can use data to improve my life and that of others.
